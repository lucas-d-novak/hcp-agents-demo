# Human Context Protocol Demo

## Project Purpose

This demo repository showcases the **Human Context Protocol (HCP)** — a conceptual framework for how personal context and preferences should flow between AI systems in a user-controlled, transparent, and interoperable way.

## Core Narrative

The demo tells a progressive story through carefully orchestrated user interactions:

1. **Human Context is Foundational** — Every meaningful AI interaction requires understanding user preferences, values, and behavioral patterns
2. **Authority Must Be Delegated Safely** — Users need granular control over how their context is accessed and used by AI agents
3. **Applications Become Powerful** — When context is portable and authority is well-defined, AI systems can truly act on behalf of users

## Design as Communication

This is not just a technical demo — it's a **narrative experience** that uses design to communicate complex ideas about AI safety, user sovereignty, and digital rights.

### Why Design Matters Here

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Each concept builds on the last through guided modals and animations
- **Emotional Resonance**: Beautiful interfaces help users connect with abstract concepts about data ownership
- **Credibility**: Polished execution signals that these ideas are ready for serious consideration
- **Memorability**: Well-crafted interactions ensure key messages stick with viewers

The visual flow from Human Context → Grant of Authority → Real Applications creates an intuitive understanding of how personal AI systems should work in the future.

## Technical Architecture

Built as a Next.js application with:
- Real-time preference extraction and storage
- Structured authority management with audit trails
- API-first design for integration with external AI systems
- Responsive, accessible UI components

This demo serves policymakers, technologists, and AI researchers who need to understand why **user-controlled context portability** is essential for a healthy AI ecosystem.
